/**
 * SIMPLETEST CLASS - System Demonstration and Validation
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 * - Demonstrates basic functionality of the swarm coordination system
 * - Validates that core components work together correctly
 * - Provides example usage patterns for the swarm framework
 *
 * TEST SCENARIO:
 * 1. Creates AgentManager to coordinate multiple agents
 * 2. Spawns 3 test agents at different starting positions
 * 3. Issues movement command to first agent (move to target)
 * 4. Runs simulation for 10 seconds to observe behavior
 * 5. Cleanly shuts down simulation
 *
 * AGENT SETUP:
 * - Agent 1: starts at (100, 100), commanded to move to (300, 300)
 * - Agent 2: starts at (200, 150), no specific commands (default behavior)
 * - Agent 3: starts at (150, 200), no specific commands (default behavior)
 *
 * MOVEMENT COMMAND LOGIC:
 * - Creates MovementCommand with MOVE_TO_TARGET type
 * - Sets target parameter to Point2D(300, 300)
 * - Agent 1 will move toward target using basic pathfinding
 *
 * EXPECTED CONSOLE OUTPUT:
 * - "Starting simple agent test..."
 * - "Created Agent_1 at (100.0, 100.0)"
 * - "Created Agent_2 at (200.0, 150.0)"
 * - "Created Agent_3 at (150.0, 200.0)"
 * - Continuous updates: "Agent 1 at (120.5, 115.3) battery: 0.98"
 * - "Test completed!"
 *
 * SIMULATION BEHAVIOR:
 * - Runs at ~30 FPS (33ms per frame)
 * - Agent 1 moves diagonally toward (300, 300)
 * - Agents 2 & 3 remain stationary or move randomly
 * - Battery levels gradually decrease based on movement
 * - Boundary collisions cause velocity reversal
 *
 * VALIDATION POINTS:
 * - Agents are created successfully with unique IDs
 * - Movement commands are queued and executed
 * - Physics simulation runs without errors
 * - Battery simulation functions correctly
 * - Simulation can be started and stopped cleanly
 *
 * PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS:
 * - Should run smoothly for 10 seconds without lag
 * - Console output should appear regularly (30-60 times/sec)
 * - Memory usage should remain stable
 * - No crashes or exceptions during execution
